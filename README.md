The goal of this exercise is to write automated tests for the TO-DO application using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io).

When you will come to visit us in our office, we will go through the code and we will pair program some test cases together. It will be the best if you can bring a computer with your working development environment already setup to speed things up.

Feel free to get creative and come up with something cool beyond what's written in the assignment if you want to impress us (we're sure you will! ðŸš€)
